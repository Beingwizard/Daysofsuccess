# 30-Day Building Challenge

Welcome to the **30-Day Building Challenge**! This is a community-driven initiative designed to help you break free from procrastination, overcome the fear of starting, and start building projects youâ€™ve been putting off for far too long. I'm not a teaching anything here, just helping you out get things done. 
Start here - https://forms.office.com/r/f5rivFYLC1

## **Benefits of Participating**
   - Move from "Iâ€™ll start tomorrow" to actually building something today.
   - Focus on practical, hands-on learning rather than passive consumption.
   - Daily tasks keep you consistent, and the community ensures you stay on track.
   - Earn mentorship and maybe some perks by proving your commitment through the challenge.
   - Collaborate, share progress, and learn with others on the same journey.

## **Key Elements of This Initiative**
   - Use hashtags like `#30daysofbuilding` and `#magic` to document your 30 days on socials such as LinkedIn, X, or even Fishbowl (perfect for those who prefer staying low-key. Not everyone is into socials, so fishbowl will help you get out social anxiety and thinking of #someoneiswatching).

   - To join, you must complete at least **3 days of coding** before starting the challenge. You can code anythingâ€”Leetcode, development, AIâ€”but you must show recent commits from the last 3 days. I'm chasing numbers here so happy to check your progress & tasks manually :)

   - This initiative is starting small with a limited group. Itâ€™s not about numbers; itâ€™s about impact. More people may join later, but for now, itâ€™s for those ready to prove themselves.

   - For now, discussions and support will happen on WhatsApp for easy communication. This may change later as the initiative grows. will share the link to a few ppl who get accepted. 

**   - Participation isnâ€™t guaranteed. Not everyone who fills out the form will get inâ€”this is for those who are ready to commit and work hard - https://forms.office.com/r/f5rivFYLC1
**

## **How This Will Help You**
   - Trust yourself not me, you're helping yourself. 
   - Gain confidence as you complete small tasks daily.
   - Identify the projects and skills that truly matter to your growth. Maybe I'll invite some Industry Leaders (5+ year exp. folks to support you)

## **What Weâ€™re NOT Doing Here**
   - This isnâ€™t another course or YouTube playlist. Youâ€™ll learn by building, not watching(I'll make sure of this).
   - While weâ€™ll guide and support you, the responsibility to build and learn is yours(I'll tell you the way to learn things quickly for whatever course you're following).
   - Mentorship is earned through completing the challengeâ€”not bought.
